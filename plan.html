            <i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i>Ask friends and family about their opinions.</h3>
          <p>
            For a harmonious celebration, it would be advantageous to coordinate with everyone involved in advance. With one exception:
            Don't ask your children what they want. As is well known, this only leads to excessively long wish lists. It is best to explain that you have no control over the wishes because that is Santa's decision. But don't forget the hint that only good children are considered. Hohohohoh .....

          <h3><i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i>Buy the X-mas gifts.</h3>
          <p>
Who knows if Santa will even come in Corona times. So when the time comes, get the presents yourself ... maybe the Christ Child will bring exactly what you wanted for Christmas. LOL.

          <h3><i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i>Take your time for baking.</h3>
          <p>
            Christmas cookies, especially gingerbread and honey bread, want to be stored for a while before they really develop their taste. Cutting out and decorating cookies are also great activities for the whole family.

          <h3><i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i> Make or buy Christmas decorations?</h3>
          <p>
            As a family, decide what the tree and Christmas decorations should look like. Handicrafts are of course much more fun, but also more labor-intensive.

          <h3><i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i> Get the X-mas tree & decorate it.</h3>
          <p>
            The most important thing when buying a Christmas tree is to make it clear to the house dog that the tree is not used to mark its territory.

            <i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i>Take enough time out.</h3>
          <p>
            Don't forget that you've been working all year. Now breaks with mulled wine and Christmas music are also indicated und test if your cookies are already tasting well..

          <h3>
            <i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i>Cook the meal.</h3>
          <p>
            Cook to your heart's content so that all you have to do is warm it up in the oven before you eat it. That reduces the stress. If you don't like cooking, delegate this job to a kitchen talent at times.

           <h3><i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i>Dress up!</h3>
          <p>
            Christmas is not a state visit. Make yourself pretty but wear something comfortable. If your children no longer believe in Santa Claus, how about you get yourself a Santa Claus costume to show them how wrong their thinking was?

        <div>
          <h3><i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i>Welcome your guests.</h3>
          <p>
            If you've switched off all lights beforehand and the candles are burning on the Christmas tree and everything smells of roast meat, nuts and almonds, the Christmas mood should soon set in.
