  <h1> üå≥ The girl in the forest üéÑüå≥üéÑ</h1>

  <p>He snorted angrily and spat on the floor in front of him. He stared again at the dial of his Chinese Rolex. No question, 8 o'clock was long past and there was no trace of the cheeky brat. What happened? Hadn't she found the way? Lost in the forest again? Women and a sense of direction just did not go together ... besides, today's youth was no longer reliable.
The graying wolf shook his head in frustration. How had he been looking forward to the fresh meat two hours ago, how much he had longed for it when - according to the Brothers Grimm script - he choked down his porous and emaciated grandmother. The old lady had certainly not been delicious. Neither the look nor the taste. But, as the wolf had consoled himself when belching, the dashing girl would have to compensate him for it, yes, he would have to compensate him! Otherwise the fairytale uncles might like him in the future.
  <br><br>
    ‚ÄúThe wolf and the 3 little pigs‚Äù, ‚Äúthe wolf and the 7 little goats‚Äù, ‚ÄúLittle Red Riding Hood‚Äù, these were all pieces that seriously affected his health and made him less and less happy. So he had to stumble around all day long in his grandmother's musty old-fashioned nightgown and now dinner was also canceled? That shit! He heard his stomach growl and felt the deep hole in his stomach. it could not go on like that. Tomorrow, he swore to himself, he would go on an indefinite sit-in strike. But tonight he still needed something to bite.
    <br>
    <br>It did not help. He had to look for Little Red Riding Hood. With a quick step he took the forest path to K√§ppchensrot. It was dawn and the shadows grew longer and longer. Every few yards the wolf stopped and sniffed. It smelled of fresh spruce leaves and fir green, but not of her, the sweet thing. The pale moonlight showed him the way across the clearing. But here, too, there was no sign of the busty beauty. Whenever the wolf thought of her, his mouth watered. Now, full of greed, he began to call out her name: "Little Red Riding Hood, Little Cap, Little Dove, where are you?" How often had the sound engineer warned him to speak in a sonorous, high-pitched voice, just like grandmother did. But no, he started roaring as he pleased. And so it was that the hunter heard him.
    <br>
    <br>
With the loaded rifle, the hunter sneaked up on the wolf from behind. His thumb released the gun. Then the hunter aimed at the wolf. But what he saw through his night-vision glass robbed him of all his concentration: a full-grown, stocky wolf with a crocheted pointed cap and cramped into a frilled nightgown that was too small, hobbled in front of him in pink felt slippers and panted for his loved one.
    <br><br> ‚ÄúHow touching‚Äù, grinned the hunter, ‚Äúwhether it is dessuted?‚Äù In short, he decided to venture a test. So he crept into the bushes, disguised his voice and breathed gently: "Here, here my darling, I am here". Then he changed his hiding place and soon he heard "Darling, here" from across the street. The wolf's eyes widened, the drool flowed out of his mouth and he immediately jumped towards the first bush. But already the voice rang out behind him. He turned around quickly. But now it echoed from the left, then from the right ... .. the wolf opened its mouth and fell on the creature next to him. .
    <br><br>
   Bang! A shot rang out. Then there was silence. Mouse silence. The silence of uncertainty lasted for a long time. Very long. It should only be interrupted by a soft melody. It was the singing of a young girl: "bumm bumm bumm chacka, chacka, he". Ok, the singing wasn't that quiet after all. Little Red Riding Hood yelled at the text as she whizzed through the forest on her moped. As a poor student, she was dependent on the money the pizza service paid her for the tour to see her grandmother. So she had allowed herself to be persuaded late at night to deliver the Quattro-Formaggio.
<br> <br>
   This night she should be lucky, because because of the shot, the wolf had become aware of the presence of the hunter and was now afraid for his life. He therefore preferred to linger silently in the bushes until the end of shooting. Meanwhile, the hunter was bleeding to death - two meters away from him. He was tangled in his own rifle.
<br> <br>
And the moral of the story: <br>
Women get lost in the forest less often than you think.
